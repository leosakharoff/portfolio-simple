    <section class="intro">
        <p>My journey into programming actually began in the world of jazz. There, I learned to think creatively and navigate the abstract—skills I use today when building interactive installations and working with sound and code.</p>

        <p>After doing my bachelor at Sonic College and working a few years as a sound designer for visual media and composing music, I constantly felt the urge to explore the more technical side of things. So I applied for the master's program at ITU—an intensive learning curve in software development that's been a great experience. Now I'm looking for a place where I can combine both worlds: technical curiosity, close collaboration, and building experiences that connect people with space, sound, and technology.</p>
